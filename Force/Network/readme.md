This uses an organisations heirarchy to demonstrate a D3 network diagram.
Clicking on a 'node' toggles a tooltip which shows additioanl information about the node.  

All the 'nodes' must be unique - eg. you cant have more than one perosn with the same name. 

The CSV must also be ordered in a certain way for the code to work correctly.
